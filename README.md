# **Student Registration System - FINAL NURZHANOVA ZARINA SE-2221**

- **Singleton**: The Singleton pattern is used for the `RegistrationManager` class to ensure that there is only one instance of this class. This is useful when you need exactly one object to coordinate actions in the system.

- **Factory Method**: The Factory Method pattern is used to create `Course` objects. It allows you to delegate the logic of object creation to subclasses.

- **Abstract Factory**: The Abstract Factory pattern is used to create `Student` objects. It allows you to create families of related objects without being bound to specific classes.

- **Builder**: The Builder pattern is used to create `Student` objects with different configurations. This is useful when an object has many possible configurations.

- **Observer**: The Observer pattern is used to notify observers of events. This is useful when the state of one object should affect other objects, but you don't want to hard link these objects together.

- **Prototype:** The Prototype pattern is used to create copies of Course objects. This is evident from the use of the clone() method in the ProgrammingCourseCopy and DesignCourseCopy classes.
